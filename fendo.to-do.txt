Fix:

Add tag list to the project descriptions.  This fails with projects of a
different language than the current language, because tag links are built
using the current language: a link to the English tag "X" built in a Spanish
page will try to link to the missing page "es.etiqueta.X" instead of
"en.tag.X".

Inform the Gforth list about this:

: traversed_pid  ( ca len -- )
  \ ca len = pid
  (traversed_pid) 0= if  \eof  then
  ;
: traverse_pids  ( xt -- )
  is (traversed_pid)  create_pids_file  
  \ pid_file$ included  \ xxx fixme this causes problems:
  \   *** glibc detected *** gforth: free(): invalid pointer: 0xb69fb7f0 ***
  \   Aborted.
  pids_file$ slurp-file evaluate  \ xxx this works

off!  (2014-02-23: I think it was solved.)
