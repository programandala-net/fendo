= Fendo to-do list

2014-08-13: --FIXED--

Subtle bug found:

the value of 'separate?' is changed by 'parse_link_text', what is a problem is this case:

   bla bla bla ( [[ http:/blabla | PROBLEM HERE ]] )

The open paren is a punctuation word that sets 'separate?' to false, in order
to print the link right after the paren. But the link code modifies it when
evaluating the link text. Only after that the link is actually echoed.

The solution could be to print <a> first, then parse and print the link text
and finally print </a>. But it seems that's how it actually already works!

Fixed by saving and restoring 'separate?' at the right place.


2014-07-13:

Update the 'modified' metadatum with the modification time of every source code
file included into the page. This way, the target modification time will be
that of the most recent source code, even if the page is older. This way the
FTP updates will be easier.

For the same reason, update the 'modified' metadatum of tag pages with the
most recent time of any of its tagged pages.

2014-06-03:

The flag 'lonely_tags_link_to_content' works with tag clouds.
Now it must work also with tag lists.

2014-04-07:

Implement author and title for block quotes, like Asciidoctor, e.g.:

<[ s" Miguel de Cervantes" quote_author! s" El quijote" quote_title! ]>
""""
En un lugar de la Mancha.
""""

That would render a proper footer under the quote block.
At the end of the block, the variables must be reseted.

In order to make unnecessary the "plain" versions of some metadata, an
'unmark' tool could be written. It could just switch all the markups off and
leave the rest in a string...

Fix:

In <fendo.parser.fs>,
link parsing fails when "]]" is at the start of a new line!

2014-03-18:

Fix:

In <fendo.parser.fs>,
link parsing fails when the link text spans the next line?

2014-03-12:

Fix:

Add tag list to the project descriptions.  This fails with projects of a
different language than the current language, because tag links are built
using the current language: a link to the English tag "X" built in a Spanish
page will try to link to the missing page "es.etiqueta.X" instead of
"en.tag.X".

finish <fendo.addon.tag_cloud_by_regex.fs>

2014-03-12:

Implement the automatic use of the alternative-language metadata (title.en,
description.eo, etc) How? A special metadatum? Defer every metadatum?

2014-03-08:

meta markups ~- and ~+ to change the separation of the next item.

2014-03-04:

Make sure all Galope and FFL modules are included to the Forth wordlist.

2014-03-03:

Lists of rencent changes?

2014-03-03:

Inform the Gforth list about this:

: traversed_pid  ( ca len -- )
  \ ca len = pid
  (traversed_pid) 0= if  \eof  then
  ;
: traverse_pids  ( xt -- )
  is (traversed_pid)  create_pids_file  
  \ pid_file$ included  \ xxx fixme this causes problems:
  \   *** glibc detected *** gforth: free(): invalid pointer: 0xb69fb7f0 ***
  \   Aborted.
  pids_file$ slurp-file evaluate  \ xxx this works
  ;

2014-02-15:

Suddenly, highlighting is done even with the flag
off!  (2014-02-23: I think it was solved.)

2014-02-28:

Check what happens if "]]" is missing in a link.
