== Description

Fendo is a website engine under development, designed to build static
websites.

Fendo is written in http://forth-standard.org[Forth] with
http://gnu.org/software/gforth[Gforth].

Home page: http://programandala.net/en.program.fendo.html

Documentation is still missing.

== Motivation, history and current status

The development of Fendo started in 2012, in order to replace two
previous similar applications written by the author (one of them
written in Forth, the other one written in PHP) with a new one that
combines the best features of both of them.

Since 2014-12, Fendo is the engine that powers
http://programandala.net[programandala.net].

On 2017-02-08, a local Git repository was created from development
backups, in order to resume the development and prepare the first
public release.

Fendo is very stable and is regulary improved, after the requirements
of the website.
