== Markup comparation table

The Fendo markup was inspired by other markups. This table shows them
all.

NOTE: Alternative marks are shown separated by spaces. Closing marks
are shown only if they are different than the opening marks; then an
ellipsis character ("…") represents the content. Some marks have a
note in brackets.
